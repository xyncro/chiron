Functional JSON for F#. This is a fairly early work in progress, but usable enough to get feedback. It provides a core functional JSON AST, a set of Aether lenses over the AST, a basic monad over a JSON type, a parser, a serializer and a mapping system based on the excellent work that Mauricio Scheffer has done with Fleece.

It's a fairly semver 1.0, but it will probably change in some small ways - bug reports etc. gratefully received.
